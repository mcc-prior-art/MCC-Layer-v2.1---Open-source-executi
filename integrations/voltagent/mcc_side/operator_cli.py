"""Operator approval step for the ESCALATE pilot scenario.

Run by the OPERATOR, inside the gateway container (which holds the operator key)
— never inside the VoltAgent agent container. It reads the pending-approval state
that the agent recorded, grants the approval (operator authority), and continues
the governed execution of the SAME proposed action.

    make pilot-approve

This is the human-authority half of ESCALATE: nothing executed before this; after
a valid approval the governed executor runs and a verified receipt yields EXECUTED.
Uses plain HTTP (httpx) against the gateway — no governance logic here.
