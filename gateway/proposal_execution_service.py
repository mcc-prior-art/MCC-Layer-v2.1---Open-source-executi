"""ProposalExecutionService — Phase 2 bridge: tenant-owned proposal -> signed
authority -> the EXISTING, unmodified governed execution path.

    authenticated tenant
    -> ProposalRegistry.get(tenant_id=, logical_operation_id=)   (ownership +
       the proposal's OWN stored action/resource/canonical payload -- the
       ONE source of truth for what is about to be authorized; never an
       independently re-supplied payload)
    -> mcc_core.authority.AuthorityModel.evaluate(identity=tenant_id, ...)
       (trusted, tenant-identity-keyed verdict: ALLOW/DENY/ESCALATE/CONSTRAIN)
    -> mcc_core.core.DecisionEngine.issue_token   (signed authority; carries
       tenant_id + idempotency_key=logical_operation_id, exactly the PR #105
       durable identity pair)
    -> mcc_core.coordinator.EnforcementCoordinator.enforce   (the ONE
       execution path this repository has: ExecutionGate verification, the
       tenant-scoped IdempotencyRegistry, velocity, audit-before-actuation)
    -> the injected upstream actuator

    PROPOSAL != PERMISSION.
    TENANT_ID != AUTHORITY.
    PROPOSAL SERVICE != EXECUTION ENGINE.

This module is deliberately the ONLY new service boundary Phase 2
introduces. It composes exclusively public primitives this repository
already ships and already uses elsewhere for the identical purpose
(``examples/governed_agent/mcc_client.py``, ``gateway/governance_service.py``,
``examples/gpt6_astra_reference/pipeline.py``) -- no new decision logic, no
new token format, no second Gate, no second ``EnforcementCoordinator``, no
second durable execution registry, and no proposal-specific actuator bypass.

Lives in ``gateway/`` (not ``src/mcc_proposal/``) deliberately:
``tests/test_proposal_service_architecture_guards.py`` statically forbids
every file under ``src/mcc_proposal/`` from importing the Gate, the
coordinator, the authority model, or the signing authority at all -- a
future refactor cannot silently smuggle execution authority into what must
stay a transport-neutral, non-actuating ingress/lifecycle boundary. This
bridge is exactly what fills the "MCC INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY BOUNDARY" layer
``mcc_proposal/service.py``'s own module docstring already draws a box for.
