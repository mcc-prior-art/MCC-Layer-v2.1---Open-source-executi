"""Pre-Execution Attestation Control — PR-2.

The Control-side boundary that makes a PR-1 ``EvidenceAttestation`` a real
input to MCC-Control, without replacing any existing primitive:

    VALID AUTHORITY
        +
    REQUIRED VERIFIED ATTESTATION
        +
    DETERMINISTIC CONTROL POLICY
        =
    ELIGIBLE FOR DECISION-TOKEN ISSUANCE

This module adds deterministic policy interpretation *above* the PR-1
cryptographic/structural verifier (``mcc_attestation.verifier.verify_attestation``,
unchanged, still the only thing that performs signature/trust/binding
verification). It does not reimplement, weaken, or duplicate that
verification, and it does not replace ``MandateAuthority``, ``DecisionEngine``,
``ExecutionGate``, or ``EnforcementCoordinator`` — it sits *before*
``DecisionEngine.issue_token()`` in the existing authority-to-token path and
decides, deterministically, whether a required attestation is present and
valid for the exact action about to be authorized.

Core doctrine (unchanged from MCC-AT-001, preserved here):

    Intelligence assesses.
    Attestation makes the assessment attributable.
    Control verifies.
    Execution acts.

Control does not classify risk and does not decide whether an Attester's
semantic assessment is *true*. It deterministically verifies whether the
required trusted evidence and authority exist for this exact action, now.
If a trusted Attester asserts ``risk_class=low`` and trusted deterministic
policy accepts ``low``, Control proceeds even if the Attester turns out to
have been wrong about the real world — that is an attestation/policy
failure, not a Control bypass. See ``specs/MCC-AT-002.md``.

An ``EvidenceAttestation`` MUST NOT itself grant authority: this module
never substitutes for, and is always evaluated *alongside*, the existing
mandate/consensus authority check performed by the caller. A valid
attestation with no valid mandate still yields no executable authority (the
caller's existing authority check already denies before Control is ever
reached); a valid mandate with a missing/invalid *required* attestation
yields no executable authority either (``PreExecutionControl.evaluate``
below).

Nonce/replay: PR-1 deliberately carried ``nonce`` without consuming it. This
module closes that gap by reusing the *existing* ``mcc_core.nonce`` replay
primitive (no second replay algorithm), with the attestation nonce
domain-separated from the decision-token nonce via a key prefix
(``attestation:<attester_id>:<nonce>``) — the same registry instance the
gateway already uses for token replay protection can be shared safely,
because the two nonce spaces never collide at the key level.
