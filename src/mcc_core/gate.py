"""Fail-closed execution gate.

No verified decision token — no execution.

Verification order: signature and key trust first, then audience and
time window, then verdict, then scope binding (policy/action/payload
hashes), then generic operation binding, then PR-3 evidence-bound
execution ticket binding (exact digest match against ``evidence_digest``
when the token carries one), and the nonce is consumed last so that a
token failing any static check does not burn its nonce.

Evidence binding (PR-3, MCC-AT-003) performs only a deterministic
canonical-document hash comparison. It does not import, invoke, or
duplicate any semantic attestation verification, trust-store resolution,
or claim-policy logic — that ownership belongs entirely to PR-2's
``gateway.pre_execution_control.PreExecutionControl``, which already ran
once, before this token was ever issued. The gate proves only that the
evidence artifact presented at actuation time is byte-identical (under
canonical serialization) to the one Control verified and bound into the
token — never that the evidence's semantic claims are true.

Any exception anywhere resolves to deny.
