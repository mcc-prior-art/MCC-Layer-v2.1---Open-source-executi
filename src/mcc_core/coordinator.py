"""Enforcement coordinator: the explicit, fail-closed execution order.

One place owns the sequence that turns a verified decision token into an
executed operation, so the ordering cannot drift:

    a. validate the decision token and its exact payload/operation binding
    b. consume the one-time nonce
    c. atomically admit the logical operation (idempotency key bound to the
       EXACT action + resource + canonical payload_hash — not payload_hash
       alone; a mismatch on any of the three is a BINDING_CONFLICT)
    d. atomically reserve velocity / aggregate capacity
    e. durably record the pre-enforcement decision (audit-before-actuation)
    f. durably commit dispatch ownership of the logical operation — the
       point of no return; nothing after this may release the key back to
       an admittable state
    g. execute
    h. durably record the outcome: EXECUTED on confirmed success, UNKNOWN on
       any exception, timeout, or failure to durably persist success

Steps (a) and (b) are the execution gate. Any indeterminate infrastructure
failure strictly *before* step (f) — a registry that cannot admit, an audit
write that cannot be confirmed, a velocity reservation that fails — fails
closed: the operation does not run, and any capacity/logical-operation
reservation already held is released (safe, because no external call could
possibly have been attempted yet). Once step (f) has durably committed,
failure is never again treated as "safe to release" — see
``docs/DURABLE_OPERATION_SAFETY.md``.
