"""Atomic velocity and aggregate controls.

Velocity limits cap *aggregate* behaviour over a time window — distinct from
idempotency (which dedupes one operation) and the nonce (which dedupes one
token). A limit aggregates by configurable dimensions (actor, source resource,
destination, action, policy scope) and can cap:

* the number of actions per window;
* the cumulative numeric amount per window (for numeric action profiles);
* the number of new destinations/beneficiaries per window.

Capacity is *reserved atomically before execution*, which is what stops
transaction splitting: four individually valid transactions cannot each pass
the same remaining ceiling, because each reservation is serialized and the one
that would cross the ceiling is refused (and any partial reservation refunded).
Cumulative ceilings therefore hold across related but separately-signed
transactions.

Fail-closed: a registry that cannot reserve denies. The configured ``on_exceed``
verdict (ALLOW / CONSTRAIN / ESCALATE / DENY) decides what an over-limit
reservation returns.
