"""Thirty-eight targeted, hand-authored security-critical mutations (PR #71,
Workstream J; extended post-merge-review to close a disclosed mutation-
testing gap -- see the ``gate-*-fail-open`` block below; extended again by
PR-5 to cover the PR-1->4 attestation-to-execution chain, which the
original 26 entirely predate -- see the trailing block below that and
``docs/ATTESTATION_INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE.md``'s gap matrix).

Unlike generic mutation testing (which mutates arbitrary operators across a
whole codebase and requires heavy tuning to separate meaningful mutants
from noise), each ``Defect`` here is a SPECIFIC, deliberately chosen
regression of a named security property this repository claims to hold --
the kind of one-line, plausible-looking, code-review-survivable change a
real regression could actually look like. Each targets an EXACT, unique
source substring (verified present exactly once before mutating, so a
future refactor that moves the code makes this fail loudly rather than
silently mutating nothing) and names the workstream test(s) expected to
catch it.

"100% detection" is the required outcome, not an assumption: this module
only DEFINES the defects; ``mutation/harness.py`` actually applies each one
to an isolated copy of the repository, runs the named detector tests
against that mutated copy, and reports pass/fail per defect. A defect
whose detector tests do NOT fail against the mutated code is a genuine,
reportable gap in this assurance suite's coverage -- never silently
dropped or reclassified as "not applicable" to make the score look better.

The 13 original defects (below) are one hand-picked mutation per security
property, spread across the whole runtime. The trailing ``gate-*-fail-open``
block is a DIFFERENT, complementary kind of coverage: an exhaustive,
systematic sweep of every single ``GateResult(False, ...)`` fail-closed
return in ``src/mcc_core/gate.py``'s ``ExecutionGate._verify``/``verify`` --
i.e. every site where a one-line ``False`` -> ``True`` edit would flip the
gate from deny to allow. It was added after a direct-verification
mutation-testing addendum found that 2 of these 14 sites (the ``verify()``
exception handler and the ``nbf``/``exp`` type-check) were not caught by a
reasonable hand-selected test oracle, even though the gate's own explicit
rejection reasons made the bug look "obviously" covered. Both gaps were
closed with new regression tests in ``tests/test_mcc_core.py``
(``test_gate_denies_when_verify_raises_unexpectedly`` and
``test_gate_denies_malformed_time_window``) before these defects were added,
so this module now proves -- not assumes -- that all 14 fail-open sites in
the gate are genuinely detected, permanently, in CI.
