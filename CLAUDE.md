# CLAUDE.md — MCC-Core / AXLOGIQ

## Project Identity

**Repository:** `mcc-prior-art/mcc-layer`  
**Organization:** AXLOGIQ Inc. (Delaware C-Corp)  
**Founder/Architect:** Alexandr Ponomariov (AX)  
**Purpose:** Public prior art record + reference implementation of MCC-Core — execution governance infrastructure for autonomous AI systems.

-----

## Core Doctrine

> **“Intent is not authority. Execution requires a verified decision.”**

The canonical four-line formula — never deviate from this wording:

```
The model proposes.
MCC-Core decides.
The gate enforces.
The audit chain records.
```

MCC-Core is **not** AI safety tooling.  
MCC-Core is **architectural maturity infrastructure** — the missing layer between AI agent intent and real-world execution.

-----

## Decision Logic

Four verdicts. No others.

|Verdict    |Meaning                                            |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
|`ALLOW`    |Execution authorized, token signed                 |
|`DENY`     |Execution blocked, gate closed                     |
|`ESCALATE` |Requires human authorization before execution      |
|`CONSTRAIN`|Execution permitted within modified parameters only|

**Default behavior: fail-closed.** If MCC-Core does not issue a signed ALLOW token, the gate does not open. Ever.

**Vertical products built on MCC-Core:**

- `MCC-I` — Infrastructure / Cloud
- `PayGuard AI` — Financial transaction governance
- `ProcureGuard AI` — Procurement governance
- `MCC-R` — Robotics
- `MCC-H` — Healthcare (future)

-----

## Technical Stack

**Language:** Python  
**Version:** v1.10.1-stable-professional  
**Signing:** Ed25519 (asymmetric) — not HMAC. Do not introduce HMAC references.  
**Audit log:** Append-only hash-chain with `fsync` on every write  
**Replay protection:** Redis-backed nonce registry  
**Policy:** `PolicyBundle` with hash verification  
**Serialization:** Canonical (deterministic field ordering before signing)

-----

## Naming & Terminology Rules

- Repository name: `mcc-prior-art` (not `mcc-prior-auth` — watch for this typo in footers/exhibits)
- Product name: **MCC-Core** (hyphenated, capital M, C, C)
- Company: **AXLOGIQ** (all caps)
- Signing: **Ed25519** — never write “HMAC” unless explicitly discussing a legacy comparison
- “Multi-Context Consensus” — do not expose in marketing without corresponding code implementation

## Positioning (LinkedIn / Public)

Primary positioning statement:

> **“Execution governance is not post-factum approval.”**

Secondary hook (Cowork context):

> **“Cowork executes. MCC decides whether it can.”**

Target audiences by product:

- **PayGuard AI** → CFO, Head of Risk, AML/Compliance officers
- **ProcureGuard AI** → CPO, Head of Procurement
- **MCC-I** → CTO, Head of Infrastructure
- **NIW case** → Framing: national interest infrastructure standard, analogous to TCP/IP / TLS

## What This Repo Is

1. **Prior art record** — timestamped public documentation of MCC-Core architecture, published April 22, 2026
1. **Reference implementation** — Python codebase with 20+ tests demonstrating the governance layer
1. **Doctrine repository** — MCC-Core Doctrine Lines v1.0, four-role governance formula, Mermaid architecture diagrams

When editing docs or code, treat this repo as a **legal and commercial artifact**, not just a codebase.

-----

## Code Conventions

- All decision tokens must be Ed25519-signed before returning
- Gate functions must be **fail-closed** — default `DENY` on any exception
- Audit log entries must be written with `fsync` — no buffered writes
- Nonce must be checked before policy evaluation — reject replays early
- `PolicyBundle` hash must be verified on load — reject tampered bundles
- Tests must cover: ALLOW, DENY, ESCALATE, CONSTRAIN paths + replay rejection + revocation

-----

## Do Not

- Do not add dependencies without explicit approval
- Do not change the canonical four-line formula wording
- Do not use “HMAC” in signing-related code or docs
- Multi-Context Consensus 3/3 is now implemented in code (`src/mcc_core/consensus.py` — N-of-M signed evaluator votes, `docs/MULTI_CONTEXT_CONSENSUS.md`); referencing it is unblocked. Keep all claims aligned with the actual N-of-M implementation — do not over-state beyond what the code does
- Do not soften the fail-closed default — it is a design principle, not a configuration option

-----

## Forward Architecture Rules

Mandatory invariants for work that has **not** landed yet. They exist so future
extensions widen the system through the correct layer instead of bypassing the
governance boundary. Do not violate these even if a task seems to ask for it —
flag the conflict to AX first.

### 1. MCP Adapter Boundary

MCP (Model Context Protocol) may be added later **only** as an ingress adapter /
ecosystem entrypoint. It is a client surface, not an authority.

- MCP must **not** become an execution authority.
- MCP must **not** introduce its own executor.
- MCP must **not** call external upstream services directly.
- Any future `integrations/mcp/` code must reach execution **only** through
  `MccClient` / the MCC Gateway / the governed contract — the same boundary the
  VoltAgent and reference-agent integrations already use.

```
MCP Client / Tool Call
        ↓
MCP Adapter (ingress only)
        ↓
MCC Gateway / governed contract
        ↓
Policy / Authority / Decision
        ↓
Execution Gate
        ↓
Governed Executor
        ↓
Receipt + Audit
```

- `integrations/mcp/` must ship with a **static CI guard** modeled on
  `tests/test_mcc_agent_no_direct_egress.py`. The guard must fail on:
  - imports of `egress_proxy.executor`
  - use of `HTTPEgressExecutor`
  - direct HTTP clients used for upstream execution
  - any direct upstream-execute method that bypasses the MCC Gateway

### 2. Real-Clinic / PHI Compliance Gate

Mock clinic workflows (the AXFlow pilot) are **not** real-clinic production
workflows. Introducing a real clinic, real patient data, or PHI is a **separate
milestone gated on compliance**, never an ordinary product PR.

- Before any real clinic / real patient data / PHI is introduced, MCC-Core must
  pass a dedicated compliance gate covering: PHI, GDPR/HIPAA-like handling,
  consent, retention, deletion / right to erasure, legal responsibility, and
  clear production disclaimers.
- Clinical or diagnostic requests remain **denied by design**.
- Raw `patient_request`, raw payload, or PHI must **not** be written directly
  into the append-only audit hash-chain. (Append-only immutability conflicts
  with GDPR-style erasure rights if raw PHI is recorded directly.)
- Required future architecture **before** any PHI:
  - the audit chain stores only hash / token / redacted fields;
  - raw patient data lives in separate, deletable storage;
  - consent and retention rules govern that storage;
  - the audit proves *what* happened without exposing *who* it happened to.
- Until that gate passes, AXFlow is presented only as a clinic revenue / booking
  **workflow simulator** — not medical advice, not a medical device, not
  production-certified.

### 3. G7 / NIW Evidence Track Separation

G7 evidence is a **legal / NIW evidence track**, not an engineering PR track.

- The engineering roadmap answers *what the system can do*; G7 evidence answers
  *how the system is proven for NIW / USCIS*. Keep them synchronized but never
  merged into one PR scope.
- Do not mix G7 / NIW evidence artifacts into product or engineering PR scope
  unless AX explicitly asks for it.
- PR titles, descriptions, and milestone wording used in NIW / expert materials
  must stay synchronized with the **actual** GitHub PR titles and contents — a
  mismatch between an exhibit and the real PR is a reviewable discrepancy.

## Before You Change Anything — Self-Check

Before editing any file, answer these four questions:

1. **Does this touch a NIW-sensitive file?** (README.md, DOCTRINE.md, any dated exhibit) → Stop. Ask AX explicitly before proceeding.
1. **Does this introduce HMAC anywhere?** → No. Ed25519 only.
1. **Does this contain the string `mcc-prior-auth`?** → Fix to `mcc-prior-art` before saving.
1. **Does this soften or remove fail-closed behavior?** → No. This is non-negotiable architecture.

If any answer is yes — pause and flag to AX before proceeding.

Run before every commit:

```bash
# 1. Tests pass
pytest tests/ -v

# 2. No HMAC references introduced
grep -r "HMAC\|hmac" src/ && echo "STOP: HMAC found" || echo "OK"

# 3. No typo in repo name
grep -r "mcc-prior-auth" . && echo "STOP: typo found" || echo "OK"

# 4. No unbuffered audit writes (fsync must be present)
grep -r "fsync" src/audit.py || echo "STOP: fsync missing"

# 5. No fail-open gates (check for default ALLOW on exception)
grep -r "except.*ALLOW\|except.*allow" src/gate.py && echo "STOP: fail-open detected" || echo "OK"
```

All checks green → commit is safe.

## NIW-Protected Files

These files are part of the legal prior art record for AX’s EB-2 NIW petition. They carry timestamps and must not be silently modified:

|File                           |Status     |Rule                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
|`README.md`                    |🔒 Protected|No structural changes without explicit approval      |
|`DOCTRINE.md`                  |🔒 Protected|Wording is legally significant — no paraphrasing     |
|Any file with `Exhibit` in name|🔒 Protected|Do not touch                                         |
|`diagrams/architecture.mmd`    |⚠️ Sensitive|Changes must preserve all four verdict paths visually|

**When in doubt: read, analyze, suggest — but do not write.**

## Advisor Mode

After completing any task, briefly note:

- One thing that could be improved in the code or docs
- One thing that could be automated

This is not optional. AX uses this to find gaps he hasn’t seen yet.
