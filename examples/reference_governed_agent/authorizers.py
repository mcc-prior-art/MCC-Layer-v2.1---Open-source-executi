"""Execution authorizers: obtain the authorization *material* an executable
verdict needs to run through the governed path.

Governance decides (ALLOW / CONSTRAIN); it does not hand out a bearer token to
execute. A separate authority still has to produce material the gate will verify:
N-of-M evaluator votes bound to a gateway-issued challenge (consensus), or a
signed mandate. This module supplies that material for the reference demo — it is
an *authorization-material provider*, playing the evaluator role.

This is NOT a governance bypass or a re-implementation of the decision engine:

* the agent still evaluates through the gateway and only executes the decision's
  authoritative payload;
* the gateway independently verifies every vote (signature, issuer trust,
  threshold, veto, and binding to action/actor/payload/resource/policy/nonce)
  before the governed executor runs;
* a wrong, missing, duplicate, or unbound vote fails closed at the gate.

In production this role is a real, independent consensus/mandate service; here it
is a deterministic local stand-in so the reference agent can demonstrate a genuine
EXECUTED result end-to-end.
