"""Live proof that the Control Room drives the REAL MCC-Core gateway.

Every test here talks to the actual ``gateway.app`` process started by
``backend.runtime.start_demo_runtime`` (see ``conftest.py``'s session-scoped
``runtime`` fixture) -- there is no mock, no stub, no second policy engine.
Numbered comments map each test to the corresponding item in the task's
"Testing requirements" list.

Each scenario in ``SCENARIOS`` is executed exactly ONCE for the whole test
session (the ``scenario_results`` fixture below) and every test reads from
that cache. This isn't just an efficiency choice: ``gateway/pilot_policy.py``
enforces a REAL velocity limit ("no more than 3 payments per actor per
minute" -- see ``PILOT_VELOCITY`` in that file), and re-running the payment
scenarios once per test would genuinely trip it, which would be this test
suite fighting the very fail-closed behavior it exists to prove.
