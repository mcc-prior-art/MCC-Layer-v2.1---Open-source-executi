"""Boots the REAL MCC-Core gateway for the Control Room demonstration.

This is the ONE module in the Control Room that imports ``gateway`` /
``mcc_core``, and it imports them only the way any ordinary external actor
already does elsewhere in this repository:

* ``gateway.app`` is imported and served as an ASGI app -- exactly what
  ``deploy/pilot/Dockerfile`` (``uvicorn gateway.app:app``) and
  ``examples/governance_http_demo.py`` already do to run the real gateway
  for a live HTTP demo. No gateway code is modified, wrapped, or forked.
* ``mcc_core.SigningKey`` is used only to generate the ephemeral consensus
  evaluator keypairs the demo needs to play the "independent evaluator"
  role -- the identical pattern ``deploy/pilot/generate_pilot_config.py``
  and ``deploy/pilot/pilot_driver.py`` already use for the Docker pilot.

This module never calls ``AuthorityModel.evaluate()``,
``DecisionEngine.issue_token()``, ``ExecutionGate.verify_token()``,
``EnforcementCoordinator.enforce()``, or ``AuditLog.append()`` directly.
Every decision, every signature, every gate check, and every audit write
happens inside the real ``gateway.app`` HTTP process this module starts;
the Control Room backend (``server.py``) talks to that process only over
HTTP, through ``pilot.client.MCCGatewayClient`` -- the repository's
existing, supported, transport-only public client.

Nothing here is persisted: keys, trust configs, and the audit log all live
in a per-run temporary directory that is safe to delete once the demo
stops. Nothing here contacts any real external system -- the "upstream"
governed execution forwards to is a local, loopback-only mock echo
service, the same pattern ``deploy/pilot/docker-compose.yml``'s
``upstream-echo`` service and ``examples/governance_http_demo.py``'s
in-process ``upstream`` app already use.
