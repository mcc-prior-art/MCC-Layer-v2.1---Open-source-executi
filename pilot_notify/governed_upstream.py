"""Receipt-verifying governed-executor adapter.

This is the "real governed executor adapter": it is the outbound side effect that
``GovernanceService`` runs *inside* ``coordinator.enforce`` (after the gate has
verified the decision token — signature, issuer, action/payload hash, actor,
resource, policy hash, nonce, replay, validity window, authorization scope — and
after the durable audit-before-execution record is written). It never decides or
bypasses governance.

It performs the real HTTP call to the mock notification service and confirms the
receipt. If the call is non-2xx, the receipt is missing/false, the correlation id
does not match, or the receipt's payload hash does not match the payload actually
sent, it raises :class:`UpstreamReceiptError` — which makes ``coordinator.enforce``
record a NON-executed result. EXECUTED is only ever returned for a confirmed,
matching receipt.
