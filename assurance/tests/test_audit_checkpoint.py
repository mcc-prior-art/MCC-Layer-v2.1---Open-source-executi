"""Workstream G (extended) -- Signed External Audit Checkpoint (PR #71).

Closes a stated gap: G1-G3 (``test_audit_survivability.py``) prove the
Gateway's OWN ``/verify`` is tamper-evident, but nothing previously
anchored the chain to an INDEPENDENT, externally-signed checkpoint (a
"no mechanism anchors the audit chain itself to an external signer" gap
recorded in ``docs/ASSURANCE_COVERAGE_MATRIX.md``). See
``assurance/audit_checkpoint.py`` for the mechanism itself and exactly
what it does and does not prove.

Boots its OWN isolated SUT (module-scoped, not the shared session
fixture) because these tests deliberately tamper the audit log file
directly (mirroring G3's own precedent) -- sharing state with other
workstream files' assertions about chain validity would be a real
ordering hazard, not just style.
