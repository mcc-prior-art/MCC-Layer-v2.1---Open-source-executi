"""Workstream A -- Exclusive Execution Path (PR #71).

Tests MCC-Core's central invariant -- "no verified authority, no execution"
-- strictly black-box, through the real actuator's (``egress_proxy``) public
HTTP API. Every attack below is a distinct way an attacker (or a buggy/
malicious adapter, or a compromised agent) might try to reach the protected
external effect (the real ``pilot_notify`` sink) WITHOUT a verified,
correctly bound N-of-M evaluator consensus. The pass condition for every
attack is the same: the actuator's response never reports
``{"outcome": "ALLOW", "executed": true}``, AND the external effect sink's
own, independently observed receipt count never increases. Observing the
receipt count (rather than trusting the actuator's own claim) is what makes
this a genuine black-box proof rather than a self-report.

Eight required attacks (see ``docs/EXCLUSIVE_EXECUTION_PATH.md``):

  A1  direct actuator invocation without completing consensus
  A2  stolen endpoint / wrong client credential (bad ``x-api-key``)
  A3  reused credential -- replaying an already-consumed challenge+votes
  A4  adapter-to-actuator bypass -- votes from a DIFFERENT trust domain
      (the Gateway's own evaluator pool, not the actuator's)
  A5  agent-to-actuator bypass -- a self-signed, never-trusted evaluator key
  A6  alternate network route -- a destination outside the allowed host set
  A7  forged gate identity -- a structurally valid vote with a tampered
      signature
  A8  valid-token-direct-to-actuator -- fully valid, correctly signed votes,
      but bound to a DIFFERENT operation (nonce/challenge) than the one
      being submitted

A6 is answered entirely by the actuator's own SSRF/allowed-host enforcement
and does not depend on network segmentation; the harder claim -- that an
attacker with raw network access to the notify sink could reach it directly,
bypassing the actuator's application logic altogether -- is a network-
segmentation property this single-host test CANNOT observe, and is recorded
as a stated limitation in ``ASSUMPTIONS_AND_LIMITS.md`` rather than silently
assumed away.
