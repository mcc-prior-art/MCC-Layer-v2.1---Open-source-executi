"""Workstream J -- Mutation Testing (PR #71; extended by PR-5).

A thin wrapper, like ``test_formal_model.py``: this does not touch the
live SUT (no ``sut`` fixture). It runs the real mutation harness
(``mutation.harness.run_all_mutants``) against all 38 targeted defects and
asserts 100% detection, so ``python -m assurance run`` surfaces the
mutation score in the same evidence bundle as every other workstream.

The original 26 = 13 hand-picked security defects + a later addition: an
exhaustive sweep of all 14 ``GateResult(False, ...)`` fail-open sites in
``src/mcc_core/gate.py`` (13 new + the pre-existing ``gate-fail-open``,
which already covered one of the 14 -- see ``mutation/defects.py``). That
addition closed a gap a direct-verification mutation-testing addendum
found: 2 of the 14 gate fail-open sites were not caught by a reasonable
hand-selected test oracle. Both are now permanently, individually asserted
here, not just informally re-checked once.

PR-5 added 12 more, closing the SAME kind of gap for the PR-1->4
attestation-to-execution chain (which the original 26 entirely predate):
attester trust/signature/action/payload/scope/expiry/replay checks, the
PR-3 TOCTOU fix, evidence_digest token binding and Gate enforcement, and
the Independent Attester Service's own schema-strictness and auth
ordering. See ``docs/ATTESTATION_INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE.md`` §6 for the
full per-mutant table and the one candidate mutation class assessed and
deliberately not added (a physical statement-reordering mutation the
harness's exact-substring-replace mechanism cannot express as a single
well-formed edit).

Each mutant boots its own isolated repo copy and runs real pytest
subprocesses (see ``mutation/harness.py``), so this is slower than the
rest of the suite (~60-90s for all 38, several of the new PR-5 mutants'
detector tests being real multi-process assurance E2E tests) --
deliberately not folded into a tighter loop, since a mutation result
silently downgraded to "good enough" would defeat the entire point of
Workstream J.
